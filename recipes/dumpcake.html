    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dump cake is a cobbler-like dessert that features a cake-like topping. It gets its name from its easy method of preparation: The ingredients, one of which is boxed cake mix, are “dumped” in a cake pan without mixing. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pie filling: </strong>This dump cake recipe calls for cherry pie filling, but you can use whatever pie filling you like</li>
        <li><strong>Crushed Pineapple: </strong>Two undrained cans of crushed pineapple (in 100% juice) lends fruity flavor and gives the dump cake a moist texture. </li>
        <li><strong>Cake mix: </strong>A box of yellow cake mix is the convenient secret ingredient in this easy dump cake recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts: </strong>Chopped walnuts take the flavor and texture up a notch. Of course, you can leave them out if you prefer. </li>
        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>Melted butter drizzled over the other ingredients makes the cherry dump cake nice, moist, and rich. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir the pie filling and pineapple together, then spread it an even layer in a cake pan. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cake mix and walnuts over the pineapple mixture. </li>
        <li>Drizzle the cake with butter and bake until golden brown. </li>
    </ol>
